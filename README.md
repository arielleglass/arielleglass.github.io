About me:

I studied Molecular and Cellular Biology at Vanderbilt University and went on to graduate with a Master of Science in Public Health Microbiology and Emerging Infectious Disease from George Washington University. At GW, I engaged in HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and Chikungunya virus research. Afterwards, I joined the Kading Laboratory at Colorado State University as a laboratory manager and researcher studying the effect of temperature on Culex tarsalis vector competence and Rift Valley Fever Virus evolution. I have experience working in a Select Agent BSL-3 laboratory and conducting experiments involving mice and mosquitoes. I am a first-year PhD student in the Cellular and Molecular Biology program with research interests in arbovirology, ecology, vector-borne disease prevention and control, transgenic mosquitoes, and disease spillover. In my free time, I love to ski, hike, rollerblade, paint, and listen to live music of all genres.
